# Telegram Vote Bot

## Overview

This is a Telegram Vote Bot built with Python using the Pyrogram library. The bot allows users to create automated vote polls for their Telegram channels, with subscription verification and participant management features.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular Python architecture with:

- **Pyrogram Client**: Telegram Bot API wrapper for bot operations
- **MongoDB/JSON Storage**: Hybrid data persistence with MongoDB as primary and JSON fallback
- **APScheduler**: Background task scheduling for subscription checks
- **Handler-based Architecture**: Separate modules for different command types

## Key Components

### Core Files
- **main.py**: Application entry point and bot initialization
- **config.py**: Configuration management with environment variables
- **VoteBot Class**: Main bot orchestrator managing all services

### Handlers
- **handlers/start.py**: Welcome messages and initial user interaction
- **handlers/vote.py**: Vote poll creation and management
- **handlers/verify.py**: Subscription verification callbacks
- **handlers/admin.py**: Administrative commands and statistics

### Utilities
- **utils/db.py**: Database abstraction layer with MongoDB/JSON fallback
- **utils/check.py**: Subscription verification logic
- **utils/keyboards.py**: Inline keyboard generation
- **utils/scheduler.py**: Background task scheduling

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact via Telegram commands
2. **Subscription Check**: Bot verifies user subscription to required channels
3. **Vote Creation**: Users create vote polls for their channels
4. **Participant Management**: Bot tracks and manages vote participants
5. **Background Tasks**: Scheduler runs periodic subscription validation

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **pyrogram**: Telegram Bot API client
- **tgcrypto**: Cryptographic operations for Pyrogram
- **motor**: Async MongoDB driver
- **apscheduler**: Task scheduling library

### External Services
- **Telegram Bot API**: Core bot functionality
- **MongoDB**: Primary database (with JSON fallback)
- **Telegram Channels**: For subscription verification

### Configuration Requirements
- API_ID and API_HASH: Telegram API credentials
- BOT_TOKEN: Telegram bot token
- MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string (optional)
- Channel usernames for subscription verification

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for Replit deployment with:

- **Nix Environment**: Python 3.11 with stable-24_05 channel
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic pip installation via workflow
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration through Replit secrets
- **Fallback Storage**: JSON files when MongoDB unavailable

### Deployment Steps
1. Set required environment variables in Replit secrets
2. Run the workflow which installs dependencies and starts the bot
3. Bot automatically handles database initialization and service startup
